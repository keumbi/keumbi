  1. Don't study for too long if you are not enjoying it. Take short breaks after 20-30 minutes. <br>
  2. Don't study in the living room, bedroom, etc. Study in a separate place dedicated to studying.<br>
  3. Don't try to memorize without understanding. Try to understand the concept first.<br>
  4. Don't always study alone. Studying in groups helps a lot.<br>
  5. Don't highlight text blindly. Highlighting doesn't help that much. It only indicates Recognization not Recollection of the topic.<br>
  6. Always take notes. Reviewing the notes after a short time helps a lot.<br>
  7. Always try to teach others what you have learned. Teaching is the best way of learning.<br>
  8. Sleep is so much important for pushing something into your long-term memory. Get at least 7-8 hours of sound sleep.<br>
  9. Use the SQ3R(survey, question, recite, read, review) method while studying.<br>
  10. Use Mnemonics. It's the best way to memorize facts.<br>
